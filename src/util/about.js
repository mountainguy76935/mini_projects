I enjoy reading, music, studying, making jokes, skiing, rock climbing, kayaking, guiding, exploring, art, coffee, chocolate lava cake, helping people, discussing crazy topics, and trivia! I also like listing off things I like, and most recently have gotten VERY into computer science and web development. There are a couple things I plan on adding to this site, but until then feel free to navigate around. I appreciate you checking it out!"

These positions involved securing housing, facilitating connection to services in the community, and providing ongoing support to help people maintain housing. I've worked in Santa Cruz and Alameda County in California while wearing many hats and positively impacting many lives."

All of the portfolio projects on this site have been completed from scratch. My projects, along with this site itself, are constantly being improved. I am fascinated and exhilirated to have finally reached a point where I have a strong foundation in web development. Where to next?"
